**Before start, let you know it's not the official clone game of Bits &amp; Bops game!**   

Let's nail it to the rhythm!   
You can move the hammer through key input.   

After playing the game, I tried to make the game similar using p5.js to make it playable on the web.

## Problem
1. When demonstrating the base-code made of p5.js on the github page, various problems should be found and corrected.
2. To solve the problem of creating 'notes' suitable for a song, I look for ways to use AI models, create them using waveforms, or refer to 'tja' files or 'ous file format'. After seeing it, I will have to edit it using an appropriate method.
